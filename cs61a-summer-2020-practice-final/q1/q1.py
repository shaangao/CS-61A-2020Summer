Su 16 Final q4
Implement the function catch up, which takes in two linked lists of integers lnk1 and lnk2 and mutates the
linked list with the lower sum by repeatedly inserting 1 at the end until the sums are equal. See the doctests
for details. You may assume that the two linked lists that are passed in are non-empty and have
the same length. The Link class is provided for your reference.

You may only use the lines provided. You may not need to fill all the lines. You may not use
methods that are not implemented in the Link class below.
Hint: You may need the ternary operator <expr1> if <cond> else <expr2>.
