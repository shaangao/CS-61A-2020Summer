;; This question is in two parts, implementing `next-run` and
;; `runs`. See the specifications above each definition
;; for details.

;; A data abstraction for a pair of a first run and the rest of a list.
(define (pair a b) (lambda (c) (if c a b)))
(define (first p) (p #t))
(define (rest p) (p #f))

;; Part (a)
;; Implement next-run, which takes a non-empty list of integers s and returns a pair of lists:
;; the longest non-decreasing prefix of s and the rest of s. Use the provided pair data abstraction.
;;
;; Your implementation should be correct even if the pair implementation were to change.
;;
;; Two equivalent definitions for what next-run should do:
;;  (1) Return a list of non-decreasing lists that together contain the elements of s.
;;  (2) Return a pair containing the first run in s (a list) and the rest of s (another list).
