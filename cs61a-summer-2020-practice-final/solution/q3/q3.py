Part (a) (4 pt) The TAs are building a social networking website called CS61A+. The TAs plan to
represent the network in a class called Network that supports the following method:
    - add_friend(user1, user2): adds user1 and user2 to each other’s friends lists. If user1 or
      user2 are not in the Network, add them to the dictionary of friends.
Help the TAs implement these two methods to make their social networking website popular!
