This question is in three parts, implementing `is_combo`, 'apply_tree', and

Definition. A combo of a non-negative integer n is the result of adding or multiplying the digits of n from
left to right, starting with 0. For n = 357, combos include 15 = (((0 + 3) + 5) + 7), 35 = (((0 ∗ 3) + 5) ∗ 7), and
0 = (((0 ∗ 3) ∗ 5) ∗ 7), as well as 0, 7, 12, 22, 56, and 105. But 36 = ((0 + 3) ∗ (5 + 7)) is not a combo of 357.
