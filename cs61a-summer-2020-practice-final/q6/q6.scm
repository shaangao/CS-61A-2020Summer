;; Su18 Mock Final q3, 5b

;; This question is in two parts, implementing `zero-cond` and
;; `zip-tail`. See the specifications above each definition
;; for details.

;; Part (a) (4 pt)
;; Write a macro called zero-cond that takes in a list of clauses, where each clause is a two-element list containing
;; two expressions, a predicate and a corresponding result expression. All predicates evaluate to a number. The macro
;; should evaluate each predicate and return the value of the expression corresponding to the first true predicate,
;; treating 0 as a false value.
;;
;; To run tests just for this part, run
;;      python3 ok -q a
;;
;; scm> (zero-cond ((0 'result1) ((- 1 1) 'result2) ((* 1 1) 'result3) (2 'result4)))
;; result3

(define-macro (zero-cond clauses)
     (cons 'cond
          (map (lambda (x) (cons (car x) (quote ,(cdr x))))
                clauses)))

;; Part (b) (4 pt)
;; Implement zip-tail, which is a tail recursive procedure that takes in two lists a and b and returns a
;; single list containing two-element lists of co-indexed elements from a and b. If one list is shorter than the other,
;; the zipped list’s length is that of the shorter list. Your solution should be tail recursive.
;;
;; To run tests just for this part, run
;;      python3 ok -q b
;;
;; scm> (zip-tail '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
;; ((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
;; scm> (zip-tail '(c 6 a) '(s 1 ! hello world))
;; ((c s) (6 1) (a !))

;; Hint: Use the built-in append procedure, which you can assume is tail recursive, to concatenate two lists
;; together. For example:
;; scm> (append '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
;; (1 2 3 4 5 6)
