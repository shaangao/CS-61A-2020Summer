Part (b)

An Organizer is a kind of object that divides the labels in a tree into a sequence of disjoint lists, one for
each of a given set of categories. To create an Organizer, one provides a sequence of predicates (one-argument
functions) that define the categories. When this object is subsequently handed a Tree, it will return a sequence
of linked lists of tree labels, one per category in the same order as the original sequence of category predicates.
Once a tree label is included in one list, it must not appear again in that list, nor in any subsequent list. Fill
in the class below to fulfill this specification. You may assume that labels are numbers or strings.
